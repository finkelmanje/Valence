So today was a pretty alright day, I guess? Fio gave her IOC presentation in English today (I had absolutely no clue that that was coming up; if I had been today, I would’ve gotten destroyed.) It snowed, which was terrific! Anyways, Fio’s IOC was excellent just like everything else that she does. Next I had MUN club, so in other words, an opportunity for more awkwardness around Fionula Herbst After that I had another boring as hell German class, and then Econ. Economics was interesting enough; I got to present my economic theory. Barbara kept joking that she should get credit for inspiring it, but Justus finally accepted that it was my idea and not his. I hope that I can make something out of it eventually; that’d be really neat. After that I had math club which was exceedingly boring, outside of having Ms. Uspenskaia suggest matrices or Gaussian Elimination as a topic for my IA, which I think might be a good idea. After THAT I had Mediterranean culture night, where K stole Kimi’s seat so she went to sit next to Louis, and I was tragically Kimi-less. I worked pretty concentratedly for a good bit of the night. I’m proud of that, and I appreciate my newfound motivation of fuck-Fio for keeping me on track. I hope that MUN isn’t too awkward with Fio.
