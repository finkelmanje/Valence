First day of Model UN! I had a great day today. First, math class was excellent because I finally learned how to use the unit circle, and I had fun talking with Justus. Next period was chem. I got back my test (37/40=93) which was very upsetting, because I missed two points because of markscheme bullshit that I absolutely ought to have gotten. I asked Dr. Lodhi whether I could take the HL test and have it graded for fun, and she said that I could. After that I had a very boring Chem Club. Next was Econ, which was very fun because we played a game where we had to see how well we knew our classmates. I got closer with Barbara, which was neat because she is very very attractive, and witty besides. Then we prepared to leave for MUN, meaning that I sat outside the StuCo room awkwardly while the girls had a meeting within. Anyways, enough of the annoying parts of the day. We got to the Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung in one piece (more or less - Ms. Jones-Heinz for some reason insisted that we were meeting at the Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung) and filed into the assembly hall. For some reason I decided to watch Fio who was sitting in front of me nearly the entire time, because I wanted Hannah to notice me doing it. Iâ€™m weird as hell, dude ðŸ˜‚. I gave a comment to the US delegateâ€™s comment on the importance of international engagement, mentioning the irony in the US advocating international openness while at the same time threatening the hefty steel and aluminum import tariffs.
