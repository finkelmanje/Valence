I don’t want to be the safe option. It’s twice now that Dagny has mentioned how beautiful it is to explore all of your romantic options before choosing the one you love — how it isn’t meaningful to choose someone by taking a ‘blind leap.’ It feels as though she’s already setting me up to watch her date someone else, but holding out the possibility of us dating in the future in order to preserve my romantic feelings for her despite the fact that it might hurt me less in the long run for me to try and smother them now. I don’t want to get my heart broken any more than it already is. I really, really don’t want to feel like I’m being put on the backburner for when she gets bored of dating other guys, and decides to come back to me, “the safe option.” She isn’t doing it to be cruel, for she couldn’t possibly do anything to willfully hurt me. I know that, at least, from the sincerity of her crying when she felt like she’d broken my heart.

I love her. I can write that now, because I think it’s the truth. I love her, but I don’t want to tear up my heart by waiting for her to come back to me, and I don’t know that I can love someone else without pressing her out of my heart. I think that the only way that I could stay friends with her if she starts dating someone else would be to find a ‘rebound’ to pour my feelings into, so that I can kill my love for Dagny without losing her as a friend.

Anyways, Houston was a fantastic trip and I don’t regret a single second of it.
