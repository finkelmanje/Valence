I guess I’ll continue my earlier entry about Leah. She told me that she may end up taking a gap year due to her gastrointestinal issues, which sort of lowkey majorly sucks? I’d been hoping to get to know her better, because she seems really interesting and funny and also cute. She’s still deciding whether to take a gap year to try and solve her stomach problems or just jump straight into freshman year, but I really hope that she ends up deciding to join us in September.

I’m definitely reading too much into this text of hers, but it’s had me thinking about it a lot so here it is for posterity.
