Alright so today was an OK day, but I don’t have much to talk about. Slept over at Sonja’s yesterday, which was alright. This morning I took the subway back to boarding and then I kinda didn’t really do anything. I Skyped Liam for a few hours which was neat, and I explained economics to him which was supposed to help me study for my test but it didn’t work out that well. I feel stupid very often.
