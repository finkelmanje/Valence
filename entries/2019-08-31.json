So Dagny talked about the Finn thing last night, assuring me that she didn’t want to get closer to him romantically, and that she’d let me know before pursuing any romantic interest because she respects me. It was a definite relief to hear those words, despite the fact that she doesn’t owe me anything of the sort.

It still stings a bit when she ignores my texts in favor of his, but that’s how it often is when you start talking to new people so I really can’t blame her at all. She also mentioned having felt the same way earlier, but I couldn’t imagine when that could’ve been because to my knowledge I’ve always left my other conversations to respond to her texts. Not that I’m doing that for her sake, of course — she just happens to always be the most entertaining person to talk to. My memory kinda Sucks though, so I could definitely imagine having done that.

I was talking to Leah earlier when she mentioned that she might have to take a gap year— will continue tomorrow.
