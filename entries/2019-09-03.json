First off, I’m sorry to you, my future self, for missing my entry yesterday. I’d usually write at night, but my night was crammed full of... too much confusing shit.

To start with, Leah lowkey raised so many unprecedented problems by confessing that she’s had feelings for me for a few months now. How am I supposed to maintain my argument of “I need to hold on to Dagny because nobody else will love me” if I don’t believe that to be true anymore? To make matters worse, I’d already put Leah in the ‘potential future girlfriend’ box, which greatly complicates this entire situation because it means that the feelings are reciprocated to some degree or another.
