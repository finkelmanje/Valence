Today was pretty neutral, I suppose. I got a 7 on my bio test, and a 100% on my math test; two good results, but entirely expected. Being around Fio was weird today. She ignored another one of my texts, but that’s alright I guess. She doesn’t live to please me, and I can find other people to talk to. I’m really looking forward to going to BERMUN, but she’s the one thing that might be super super awkward there. Oh well, that’s life. I wish that I could explain to her my plan;

I was bound by my word to not bring up the matter to you, and so I spoke to two people whom I knew would not spread a rumor without going through you - Lucas and Soheyla - in the hopes that they would ask you about it and you would reassure me that this was untrue. As it turns out, what I had planned came to pass without any hiccup, save for the fact that I had failed to realize that it would hurt you to hear accusations that didn’t square with anything that you had done.

I also wish that I could be closer with Kimi, but that dumb thing is bothering me. I didn’t know how hard it could be to be friends with someone who is unintelligent. I didn’t think that I was that shallow.
