Today was a useless day, I guess. Not too much happened. During Econ I took a test, and I think I did fairly well except on one of the questions about economic growth vs. inequality I kinda took the opportunity to soapbox about the centralization of power in the hands of the bourgeoisie when I should’ve been evaluating more economically. It was alright though; maybe that’s something to show Fio. I love her so much that it hurts my heart to think about her. I want to tell Soheyla that I don’t have romantic feelings for Fio anymore so that she would tell Fio, but I feel like Fio might get offended at the thought that I could lose my feelings so quickly. This sounds sketch, but that’s sort of how I would feel about the matter. As always, using myself as a model to see how Fio will react. It’s just tricky to correct for my autism lmao. During Lunch I had a StuCo meeting where we talked about plans for future events, and Soheyla and Liza were trying to argue but Liza seemed sort of confused the entire time. I could see that she wanted to establish a school event as demonstrable evidence of StuCo’s involvement in order to please some faction of her constituency, and then she also wanted to focus StuCo’s efforts on grades 11&12 alone. Soheyla on the other hand wanted to make purchases to maximize total utility, rather than spending money on quickly-disappearing pizza.
