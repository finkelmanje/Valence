Dear Chris,

Today I did something Stupid. Don’t question why I chose to name you Chris. I guess it’s a standard masculine name without much behind it. Anyways, what I did was send Dagny a brief video of Harriet bending over to play with Boba... with the express intention of making her jealous. Stupid move, I know. I’m greatly ashamed about having acted that way. That brings us to... 8:49 pm, where she sent me a few texts talking about how cool Finn Paisley is, (maybe???) in an attempt to make me jealous in return. It worked, big-time :(

Anyways, I told Harriet about it and she offered to try making out with me to see whether it’ll help reduce my feelings for Dagny. I think that might be a good idea so I told her as much, but I’m still scared and confused about what to do from here. I don’t want to lose Dagny.

Also of note is-
