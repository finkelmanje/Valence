The SAT was alright, I had no idea what to do though when it asked me how to find the third side of a non-right triangle when the other two sides are 6 and 13. Also, I sort of maybe cheated when I corrected my answer from 2/15 to 2/14 just after the time ended. I might still lose that point, actually, because I ought to have written 1/7. At MUN I arrived just before closing ceremonies, which were pretty boring. I asked the super cute delegate of Iran for her Snapchat, though :) then I got home and made a pizza and played a ton of MINECRAFT with my Eternal Wife Kimi Rehsi, that was super dope.
