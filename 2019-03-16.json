Today was a weird ass day. First period I took my chem test and it was absolutely horrid. It was the unit 3 one on periodicity and I knew nearly nothing on the test. I studied the totally wrong stuff, and I was so scared. Thank god Dr. Lodhi told me that the test isn’t being graded, and that it’s only to show me where I am in terms of periodicity. After that I had English, which was very nice and relaxing, though I was upset eith Ms. Barker gone. Sophie kept looking over at me, which was kinda odd but I didn’t think anything much of it. Next I had lunch, and I met with Ms. Schnoor. We cleared that I would take tests for HL in my SL classes at the end of the year, after the normal IB tests. The school would administer these special tests, and then send the data off to the universities to which I’m applying. Next was TOK. Mr. Alvarez was gone, so Mr. Milner covered for him. Linus turned to me and said ‘did you notice that Sophie keeps looking over at you?’ I don’t know what’s up with that. I hope that she thinks that I’m cute, because I think that she’s super cute myself. I’ve been trying to convince myself that it’s just because Fio told her something bad about me. I don’t know why I do that hahah. Afterwards I just played a shitton of minecraft my dude. Like legit 6 hours.
