So, here I am. Heart broken, lying in bed with the girl who led to me breaking it for myself. Because I don’t know when I’ll read this next, or how wholly I’ll be able to hold this in my memory, here’s some recap. Dagny Elise Carlsson, the first girl I’ve ever really really liked, told me that she doesn’t want to date me because it’s too early in the year for a relationship, and she needs to work through her Carl-tainted past. I guess now’s as good as time as any to begin journaling, so here goes nothing. I feel like a fucking failure. I feel emasculated and weak. I wanted to lose my virginity to Dagny, the girl I loved(?), but I wasn’t even able to stay hard enough for a blowjob. She’s told me that she wants to date me more than anyone else, and yet she keeps mentioning that her love isn’t exclusive. She’s cried and told me that she never wants me to stop loving her, but to all appearances it seems as though she wants to date other guys while leaving me and my feelings simmering on the back-burner. I don’t know what I want. I want to wait for her, but I don’t want to get my heart broken if she starts dating another guy. I want to date her, but I don’t want to place any pressure on her, which I’d be doing by pushing us to go too quickly. I want to kill my feelings for her, but I don’t want to close the door on ‘us’ forever, and I also don’t want to push her out.
