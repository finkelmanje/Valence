I’m writing now, because I chose to write despite having no fixed topic in mind to write about. Or maybe I chose to write because I have no fixed topic in mind to write about. In any case, I’ve got a lot of thoughts in my mind that I hope to press out and catch in these pages before they’re consigned to the long halls of my unremembering mind.

‘First is the worst’ goes the saying, so here’s to addressing the topic that’s weighing on me most heavily — Dagny! I don’t know why the fuck I couldn’t stay hard! I told her that it’s because I felt uncomfortable about being with someone who didn’t like me back in the same way, but that’s probably a fucking lie! In any case, it makes me feel emasculated and weak and like some kind of pathetic loser. Further, I’ve come to a decision (which may well change in the next few days) that it’s going to be business as usual with Dagny until she tells me that she’s fallen for someone else, which is when I’ll take a break from our friendship to kill my love for her. I don’t want to lose her. I really, really don’t want to lose her.

What else is there to even talk about? I thought my head was full of thoughts, but it seems as though it’s only full of thoughts of her. I suppose I could write about Stanford — I’m beyond afraid that I’ll fail, and end up amounting to nothing despite the several allowances I’m being afforded through my access to academic accommodations.
